# MRTWin Usage Docs

*WIP @jsteb january 2024*

## General Notes

At its core, the MRTWin framework and pipeline can be used to perform integrated MR sequence development and simulation of the MR images. The neat part of the pipeline is given by the ability to directly read in any valid `.seq` file and simulate the forward process.

The sequence development part is handled via Pypulseq [(GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/imr-framework/pypulseq). The simulation part is handled via the `MRZeroCore` package [(GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/MRsources/MRzero-Core), where the ominous üëª phase distribution graph (PDG) formalism is used. Peruse [Magnetic Resonance in Medicine Preview](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/toc/15222594/0/0) site for the soon-to-be-released paper by Moritz Zaiss et al.

The backend makes use of the tensor machinery and automatic differentiation engine of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). The reconstruction of the data utilizes the `torchkbnufft` package [(GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/mmuckley/torchkbnufft) to perform non-uniform Fast Fourier Transform with Kaiser-Bessel gridding in PyTorch.

## Usage Notes @ `julia` cluster machines

For ease of usage, we installed the MRTwin pipeline on the `julia` cluster machines. First gain access to the desired machine by following the tutorial written by Max. The first step is to join the JMU VPN network. You cannot access the `julia` cluster machines from the outside internet. Afterwards, basal access is usually achieved via `ssh` using the floating IP of the desired machine.

| Host Name   | Floating IP    | SSH Key Name |
| ----------- | -----------    |-----------   |
| mrf1        | 10.106.246.104 | mrf1_key.pem |
| mrf2        | *unknown*      | *unknown*    |

>:warning:**Warning** Currently, we all operate as the same user `ubuntu` on the various `julia` cluster machines. Make sure to not accidentally delete or corrupt any data of your colleagues üò±. Further, we have to coordinate the resources of the machines. It is a good idea to check that the machine you intend to use for your calculations is not currently occupied by a fellow researcher. Otherwise, resource fighting of the jobs/processes may dramatically slow down the computations. üêå You can check the current resource consumption in the terminal with the `htop` command. If either CPU usage or memory consumption is high, you may have to select another host üíª or contact the colleague to stop being a resource hog üêó.

### GUI Method üåªü¶ã

You can use the [virtual network computing (VNC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing) protocol together with a suitable client (e.g. [TigerVNC](https://tigervnc.org/)) to gain GUI access to one of the host machines. Then open a terminal session inside the Ubuntu GUI. Then you You should see something like the image below.

Use the `conda` [environment activation tutorial](#enabling-the-correct-conda-environment) to activate the `mrtwin` environment. Then you may use your desired development tool of choice, e.g. Spyder IDE (command `spyder`), Jupyter Notebooks (command `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter nbclassic`), VS Code (command `code`), etc. pp. to implement and simulate the new hottest MR sequence! üî•

### Hacker Method üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

You can avoid the VNC protocol and sending GUI screen content over the network and setup a complete remote development environment! ü•≥ This may provide a leaner setup and may be more responsive as well.

Depending on the desired development tools, you will set up the remote connection differently:

#### Spyder Remote Setup

See the Spyder docs to connect to a remote kernel running on the `julia` cluster.
Tutorial: [Link](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/panes/ipythonconsole.html#connect-to-a-remote-kernel)
The advantages over full GUI transmission are similar to the ones specified in [jupyter notebook setup](#jupyter-notebook-setup).

#### VS Code Remote Setup

Connect to the `julia` cluster VM via the VS Code remote module. This allows both classic file-based development and Jupyter notebook-based development inside VS Code.
Tutorial: [Link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview)

#### Jupyter Notebook Setup

Upon gaining shell access to one of the `julia` cluster machines, you can start a headless Jupyter notebook server with the commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=$YOURPORT
```

for the most recent Jupyterlab notebook experience or

```bash
jupyter nbclassic --no-browser --port=$YOURPORT
```

for the classic Jupyter notebook experience. The server is headless due to the `--no-browser` flag and expects connections via a user-specified port `$YOURPORT` (i.e. a free port, specified as an integer between 0 and 65535). The browser-based notebook experience allows the usage of cool and interactive tools like [`ipywidgets`](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to live-modify sequence and simulation parameters! To access the notebook in your local browser, you have to create a `ssh` tunnel that correctly connects your local machine to the remote cluster machine where the `jupyter` notebook server runs.

##### Creating a `ssh` tunnel

When you want to access the `jupyter notebook` in your local browser (i.e. the `hacker` way ;)) then you need to create a `ssh` tunnel such that the network traffic is forwarded to the `jupyter server` on the remote `julia` cluster machine. The command to start the `ssh` tunnel is

```bash
ssh -N -f -L  $LOCALPORT:localhost:$YOURPORT:localhost username@hostname
```

where the `$LOCALPORT` is the one you want to access on your local machine (it is advisable to use `$LOCALPORT == $YOURPORT` for ease of use) and `$YOURPORT` is the chosen port the `jupyter server` is listening to. Use the login credentials for the `mrf` cluster machine that were given to you by Max or Jannik. The arguments do the following: `-N` makes that no remote command is executed since the connection is established only for port forwarding, `-f` ensures that the tunnel is run continuously in the background and `-L` specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side. Many of these steps can be automated via the `~/.ssh/config` file such that you do not have to type them again or recall them tediously via your shell history. See e.g. the [`ssh` manpages](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ssh). If everything is working, you can access the `jupyter notebook` environment in your local browser under the address `localhost:$LOCALPORT`.

### Enabling the correct `conda` environment

The `julia` cluster machines should have `conda` preinstalled. If not the case, contact Jannik for bugfixing üêõüß∞ purposes. In the bash terminal, you should see the `conda` environment prefix, in the above example `(base)`, your user name (here `ubuntu`) and the current host name (here `mrf1`). Before starting off, you have to activate the correct `conda` environment to be able to access all package elements of the MRTwin. For this, you should activate the preinstalled environment `mrtwin` with the command

```bash
conda activate mrtwin
```

A list of all `conda` environments can be printed via the command `conda env list`. The successful activation of the `conda` environment is reflected in the changed environment prefix in front of the user name and host name specification.
